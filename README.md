This is a simple and effective Streamlit web app that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn from an e-commerce platform, using a machine learning model trained on customer behavior data.

##Features
-Predicts customer churn using a trained machine learning model.
-Takes user inputs like tenure, order count, session time, complaints, etc.
-Displays clear results with helpful visual indicators.
-Allows CSV upload for quick exploratory data analysis (EDA).
-Easy-to-use interface, built with Streamlit.
-Can be run locally or deployed directly on Streamlit Cloud.
